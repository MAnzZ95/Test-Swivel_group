* all the servises are working fine and I configered swagger UI for it.
* In this tight time frame I unable to complete the assignment fully only one UI part is remaining, because I recently study the angular 9.So I will commit new code blocks to my git branch ASAP.
* DB backup also I attached here, also I used the EFcore code first approach for the DB connectivity as mentioned in the document. 
* Also I added unit test cases for sample functions.
* As my references for this project, You tube tutorials, stackover flow, Documentions, etc.. I can mentioned here. 

Best Regards,
Supun
